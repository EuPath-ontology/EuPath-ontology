# EuPathDB-ontology

The EuPathDB ontology is an application ontology developed to encode our understanding of what data is about in the public resources developed and maintained by the Eukaryotic Pathogen Database Bioinformatics Resource Center (EuPathDB; http://eupathdb.org). The EuPathDB ontology was built based on the Ontology of Biomedical Investigations (OBI) with integration of other OBO ontologies such as PATO, OGMS, DO, etc. as needed for coverage. Currently the EuPath ontology is primarily intended to be used for support of the EuPathDB sites. Terms with EuPathDB ontology IDs that are not specific to EuPathDB will be submitted to OBO Foundry ontologies for subsequent import and replacement of those terms when they are available.
