VBassay:0000101	short interspersed nuclear elements polymerase chain reaction	short interspersed elements PCR	A polymerase chain reaction that amplifies short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs).	PMID: 12711348	Jie Zheng	subclass	polymerase chain reaction
VBassay:0000102	nested polymerase chain reaction	nested PCR | nested-PCR	A polymerase chain reaction with modification intended to reduce non-specific binding in products due to the amplification of unexpected primer binding sites. The nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) involves the use of two primer sets and two successive PCR reactions. The first set of primers are designed to anneal to sequences upstream from the second set of primers and are used in an initial PCR reaction.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_polymerase_chain_reaction	Jie Zheng	subclass	polymerase chain reaction
VBassay:0000103	immunoelectrophoresis	IEP	An electrophoresis that separates and characterize proteins based on reaction with antibodies.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoelectrophoresis	Jie Zheng	subclass	electrophoresis
VBassay:0000104	counter current immunoelectrophoresis		An electrophoresis in which antigen and antibody move in opposite directions and form precipitates in the area between the cells where they meet in concentrations of optimal proportions.	http://www.ispybio.com/search/protocols/ie%20protocol2.pdf	Jie Zheng	subclass	electrophoresis
VBassay:0000105	ligase detection reaction	LDR	"A linear amplification that uses a thermostable ligase to amplify a piece of DNA. Because the enzyme retains activity after multiple thermal cycles, the ligations may be repeated to linearly increase product."	MIRO:20000103	Jie Zheng	subclass	linear amplification
VBassay:0000106	loop-mediated isothermal amplification	LAMP	An enzymatic amplification in which a piece of DNA is amplified at a constant temperature of 60 - 65 degree C using either two or three sets of primers and a polymerase with high strand displacement activity in addition to a replication activity. This amplification does not need thermal cyclers and may be a low cost alternative to PCR.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop-mediated_isothermal_amplification	Jie Zheng	subclass	enzymatic amplification
VBassay:0000108	pathogen detection objective		An organism feature identification objective that aims to identify whether organism has pathogenic disposition (IDO_0000450).	VEuPathDB	Jie Zheng	subclass	organism feature identification objective
VBassay:0000115	insecticide resistance detection objective		An organism feature identification objective that aims to detect insecticide resistance of an organism 	VEuPathDB	Jie Zheng	subclass	organism feature identification objective
